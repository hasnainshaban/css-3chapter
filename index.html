    <h1>INSTAGRAM</h1>

    <p class="intro">H@$N@IN <a class="breed" href="https://www.instagram.com/hasnainjutt44//
                youtube">instagram</a>Instagram allows users to edit and upload photos and short videos through a
        mobile app. Users can add a caption to each of their posts and use hashtags and location-based geotags to index
        these posts and make them searchable by other users within the app. Each post by a user appears on their
        followers' Instagram feeds and can also be viewed by the public when tagged using hashtags or geotags. Users
        also have the option of making their profile private so that only their followers can view their posts.

    <h1>TIKTOK</h1>

    <p class="intro">The <a class="TIKTOK" href="https://www.tiktok.com/">
            TikTok</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a
        herder and guardian of sheep.</p>

    <p> some ways, TikTok “recreates the regulatory challenges that came before it,” as Jesse Hirsh has noted. They
        include privacy concerns, harms from online content, and growth at the expense of content moderation. But there
        is one crucial difference, at least for US lawmakers — they are dealing with a company not mainly based in the
        United States and not created on American free-speech ideals. TikTok has, ironically, made it clear to US-based
        politicians and officials how other countries might feel about companies like Facebook or Google.
